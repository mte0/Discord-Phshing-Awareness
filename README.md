# Discord-Phshing-Awareness
This is a template repository YOU can use to help spread the word about Discord phishing! This site shows a fake embed when sent in discord chats and attracts people to site. People who think this is real get an explanation on how to tell apart real and fake nitro.

# Setup
Simply press the 'Use this template button' where the download button normaly sits.
THen follow any tutorial on how to host a website and link it to a domain name.

## Tips
- [Free hosting for 3 sites](https://cpmlink.net/tqVvAQ) - This is a website I have personally tested, although I can't guarantee much it works.
- [Free domain names](https://cpmlink.net/t6VvAQ) - This is a legit site that can give you domain names for free, although the TLDs are mainly .gq, .gq, .tk, .cf, .ml

MAKE IT VERY CLEAR FOR THE TEAM OF WHERE YOU ARE HOSTING YOUR SITE THAT IT IS A PHISHING PREVENTION PAGE!
If you want to use the free hosting i mentionned, make sure not to get a .tk domain as they have blacklisted it.

# Sponsor
Purchasing domains and hosting like I have done costs money, and if you rather not bother setting up your own, please do feel free to send me a couple of bucks to help get another domain setup.

Domains can be as cheap as $8 a year.
